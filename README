Wrapper to add arc lint support to vim.  Inside vim:

:set makeprg=syntacticarc
:set errorformat=%f:%l:%c:%t:%m


Then, type ":make" and you'll see lint errors.

Can also support syntactic (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic).
Just replace syntastic/syntax_checkers/php.vim with the provided one here.
